#### TODO

* [x] Implement constructor for the _Candidate_ and _Party_ classes
* [x] Implement getters and setters for the _Candidate_ and _Party_ classes
* [x] Implement methods to display/save reports about the candidates and parties lists in _ElectionInfo_ class
* [x] Create a JAR file called `vereadores.jar` with the compiled classes and a `MANIFEST.mf` file
	> The MANIFEST file will define the main class  
	> The _main_ method of the **Main** class must receive the following parameters:  
		- `candidates_file`: the path to the candidates file  
		- `parties_file`: the path to the parties file  
		- `election_date`: the election date  
	> The execution command is:  
		`java -jar vereadores.jar <candidates_file> <parties_file> <election_date>`  
* [x] Create a Ant `build.xml` file
* [ ] Create a documentation for the project in PDF format
